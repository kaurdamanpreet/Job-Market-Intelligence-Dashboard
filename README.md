Job Market Intelligence Dashboard (Canada)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Canadian job market using cleaned job posting data and presents insights through data processing (Python) and visualization (Tableau).
The goal is to understand job trends, work type distribution, salary patterns, and experience-level insights in a simple and visual way.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Jupyter Notebook

Tableau Public

Git & GitHub

CSV Dataset
🔄 Data Cleaning & Processing

The dataset was cleaned in multiple steps:

✅ Step 1: Initial Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Standardized column names

✅ Step 2: Feature Refinement

Filtered relevant job roles

Cleaned salary fields

Normalized experience levels

✅ Step 3: Final Processing (Python Script)

Converted cleaned data into final analysis-ready format

Saved processed CSV for Tableau visualization

📈 Data Visualization (Tableau)

The Tableau dashboard includes:

Salary by Experience Level

Salary by Company Size

Work Type Distribution (Remote Jobs)

Job Role Frequency Analysis

📌 Important Insight:
The dataset currently contains only Remote jobs, which is why the Work Type pie chart shows a single category. This reflects the actual data and is not a visualization error.

🎯 Key Learnings

Real-world data may not always contain multiple categories

Tableau visualizations depend entirely on available data

Python + Tableau is a powerful combo for data analytics projects

GitHub project structure matters for clarity and professionalism
